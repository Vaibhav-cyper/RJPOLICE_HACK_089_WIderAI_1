In this file, we are dropping the step-by-step process of how we are going to build the chatbots for the police feedback.

First:-

To create the chatbot we need to go to botpress and create a workflow of the chatbot:-
After creating the chatbot we need to create we need a whole structure of the bot and how it's going to take the input and generate the response according to the user.

after creating the structures we need to design whole workflows and make the chatbot.

Second:-

for storing the inputs from the user we are going to use the website called Airtable, it store all the information shared by the user.
and for storing the information from the user in Airtable we need a medium to transfer all the information from botpress to Airtable and that medium is Webhook provided by Zapier

third :-

for automation botpress all going to do it by itself , and it automatically update the records whenever the input is given by the user.
