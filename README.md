# RJPOLICE_HACK_089_WIderAI_1

This is the repository where we create solutions for rajasthan police to get the people's feedback on police interactions. We are making this solution by low code platforms like - Botpress(for creating bot), Zapier (for all the automation) and Airtable (for storing the user input and effectively showcasing the information)
